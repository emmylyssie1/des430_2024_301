    <h3>Title Here Bla Bla</h3>

    <h3>Here are some guidelines:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Select a real project, not a dream.
    This is a dream: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/katescreations/freeze-dried-sweet-treats?ref=discovery_category">Click Here</a>
    This is a project: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/klos/carbon-fiber-concert-ukuleles">Click Here</a>
    What is the difference? The ukulele is ready, there is a target audience and a price for the product.
    Select a project with considerable content.

    </ul>
    <p>There is a lot of explanation about the project and high <br>resolution images from the product without any graphics and text on them.
    Tip: check the official website of the product for high resolution images.</p>

    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, <br>as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</li></p>
